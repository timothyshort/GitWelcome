### This is a simple starter code to work with a file and make some changes and commits

1. Fill in the blanks with your information. Then make a commit (git add / git commit -m)
2. Add a new line with your ID and email. Then make a commit (git add / git commit -m)
3. Now revert to the previous version before adding ID and email. (git checkout <>)
4. Then add just your ID. Then make a commit (try using git commit -a -m)
5. Look at your past commits (git log)
